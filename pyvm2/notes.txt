Objective:
    design a rudimentary assembly language for a fictional CPU
        load stuff in to ram 
        add/sub/mul/div
        render to a 'screen'
    implement the core instructions of the CPU
    add 'video' display/vram and associated instructions.
        video memory will be added to the end of 'real' memory.
